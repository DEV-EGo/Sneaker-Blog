                <h2> Sneaker Of the Decade</h2>

                <p class="main-text">
                    Kanye West originally designed a shoe for Adidas in 2006, but it was never released.[2] The first
                    brand
                    to officially collaborate with Kanye West was Bape. Together, West and Bape released a pair of
                    Bapesta
                    "College Dropout" shoes, which are now quite rare and garner high resell prices.[3] He has also
                    designed
                    shoes for Louis Vuitton and Giuseppe Zanotti, and (most notably) Nike.[4] His collaboration with
                    Nike
                    lasted for five years and led to the release of a total of three (two silhouettes, Yeezy 1 and the
                    Yeezy
                    2) sneaker styles. In 2013, after the release of the "Red October" Air Yeezy 2s, Kanye West
                    officially
                    left Nike. Although West described this break as "heartbreaking", he claimed that Nike would not pay
                    him
                    royalties for his shoe designs, instead offering to pay some of the proceeds to a charity of West's
                    choice.
                </p>



                <p class="main-text">
                    This ultimately led West to reach out to Adidas. Adidas agreed to give him royalties, and West
                    described the CEO of Adidas as "someone who allowed [him] to build something".[5] In February 2015,
                    a
                    year and three months after the confirmation of the Adidas and Kanye West collaboration, the
                    collaboration officially debuted. "Yeezy Season 1" was highly anticipated and celebrities such as
                    Rihanna, Diddy, and Kim Kardashian were at the showing. "Yeezy Season 2" and "Yeezy Season 3" also
                    saw
                    notable amounts of success upon their releases.
                </p>

                <h2>WHERE ARE YOU YEEZY</h2>

                <p class="main-text">

                    Since announcing their partnership in 2015, Kanye West and adidas have been dominating the
                    fashion
                    world. From sneakers to clothing, their line has gone against the grain and disrupted the normal
                    perception of style. Back at it again, the two sides are set to release another edition of the
                    Yeezy
                    BOOST 350 V2. Available ONLINE only, you won’t want to miss out on the adidas Yeezy 350 V2
                    ‘Cinder.’

                </p>

                <p class="main-text">

                    Kanye has been wearing adidas since his College Dropout days but everyone was waiting to see
                    what
                    Kanye would wear first after he penned with the brand. Technically he went with the Y-3 Qasa
                    Racer a
                    few months earlier, but we all wanted to see the first true adidas move. While in Paris, Kanye
                    stepped out in the ZX 710 OG showing the strong heritage of the brand and the direction he would
                    be
                    taking his own brand.

                        Jordan sneakers usually sold out instantly online or in stores the past 2 decades ; but all of
                        that has come to a halt. A new player is in town and his name is Kanye West. The Yeezy line up
                        has been said to sell out in milli seconds and being resold online at places such as
