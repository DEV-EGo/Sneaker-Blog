            <h2> Sneaker Of the Decade</h2>

            <p class="main-text">
                Kanye West originally designed a shoe for Adidas in 2006, but it was never released.[2] The first brand
                to officially collaborate with Kanye West was Bape. Together, West and Bape released a pair of Bapesta
                "College Dropout" shoes, which are now quite rare and garner high resell prices.[3] He has also designed
                shoes for Louis Vuitton and Giuseppe Zanotti, and (most notably) Nike.[4] His collaboration with Nike
                lasted for five years and led to the release of a total of three (two silhouettes, Yeezy 1 and the Yeezy
                2) sneaker styles. In 2013, after the release of the "Red October" Air Yeezy 2s, Kanye West officially
                left Nike. Although West described this break as "heartbreaking", he claimed that Nike would not pay him
                royalties for his shoe designs, instead offering to pay some of the proceeds to a charity of West's
                choice.
            </p>



            <p class="main-text">
                This ultimately led West to reach out to Adidas. Adidas agreed to give him royalties, and West
                described the CEO of Adidas as "someone who allowed [him] to build something".[5] In February 2015, a
                year and three months after the confirmation of the Adidas and Kanye West collaboration, the
                collaboration officially debuted. "Yeezy Season 1" was highly anticipated and celebrities such as
                Rihanna, Diddy, and Kim Kardashian were at the showing. "Yeezy Season 2" and "Yeezy Season 3" also saw
                notable amounts of success upon their releases.
            </p>


            <h2>WHERE ARE YOU YEEZY</h2>

            <p class="main-text">

                Since announcing their partnership in 2015, Kanye West and adidas have been dominating the
                fashion
                world. From sneakers to clothing, their line has gone against the grain and disrupted the normal
                perception of style. Back at it again, the two sides are set to release another edition of the
                Yeezy
                BOOST 350 V2. Available ONLINE only, you won’t want to miss out on the adidas Yeezy 350 V2
                ‘Cinder.’

            </p>

            <p class="main-text">

                Kanye has been wearing adidas since his College Dropout days but everyone was waiting to see
                what
                Kanye would wear first after he penned with the brand. Technically he went with the Y-3 Qasa
                Racer a
                few months earlier, but we all wanted to see the first true adidas move. While in Paris, Kanye
                stepped out in the ZX 710 OG showing the strong heritage of the brand and the direction he would
                be
                taking his own brand.
